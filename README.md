# 3D sc-Way

The SC-WAY: A 3D campus guide in Bulacan State University-Sarmiento Campus offers a virtual 3D tour of the campus, 
allowing users to navigate through a 3D representation of the campus. Users will be able to access a street view of 
the campus and explore it virtually by walking through it.

This is our capstone project, created a virtual tour of my campus using [Pannellum](https://pannellum.org/) Package and laravel framework.
